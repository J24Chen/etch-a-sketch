So to create the 16x16 boxes, will need to adjust flexbox to incorperate 16 rows of boxes at once.
Probably will ahve to adjust the grow/shrink rate. But research that to see how flexbox works to incorperate a set number
of boxes first.


Layout

HTML/css contains:


- grid
- max width
- max height


JS contains
- gridDimensions
- 


logic:

let grid be a flex-direction:column

Loop through JS, create a div and create 16 other divs that fit inside it.

for (int i = 0; i < gridDimensions; i++){
    createDiv == `row${i}`
    append row div to grid div
    for (int i = 0; i < gridDimensions; i++){
        createDiv == `column ${i}`
        append column div to row div
}
}
